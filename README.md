# DSA-Tracker
A minimal, personal DSA (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) progress tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project helps track daily DSA study progress based on a self-defined plan, with data stored locally using LocalStorage.  Designed to be simple, distraction-free, and fully offline.
